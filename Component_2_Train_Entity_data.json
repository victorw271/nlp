    "text": "On 2\/18\/87, at 0001 hours, during normal steady state operation, (Mode 1, at 100 percent power) and no rod motion in progress, the Control Room operators observed a decrease in reactor power and that No. 2 control rod's position lights indicated that it had dropped. The operators immediately began to reduce generator load to restore the main coolant system Tave per plant procedure. At 0003 hours the reactor protection system initiated an automatic scram as the result of a high main coolant pressure condition. The high main coolant pressure occurred because the load reduction by the operator overcompensated for the power reduction from the dropped rod. The NRC was notified via the ENS at 0101 hours February 18, 1987. The root cause of this event was determined to be a procedure inadequacy. An engineering evaluation following the event concluded that a manual load reduction was inappropriate and could result in a high pressure trip from overcompensation, as was experienced. The manual load reduction requirement was subsequently removed from the immediate action of the procedure. The stationary gripper coil which had an open circuit was replaced in kind.  All systems performed as intended during this occurrence. There was no adverse effect to the public health or safety as a result of this event.",

The primary cause of this event has been attributed to personnel error.

A second factor was the lack of communication between the turbine operator and the reactor operator which delayed timely compensatory actions. Plant response was normal following the scram. Corrective actions were taken to reinstruct personnel and establish a direct communications link between the turbine operator and reactor operator.

The loss of power to NI Cabinet \"A\" was a result of a failed Sola Transformer (Type CV) within the NI Cabinet. The loss of power produces a loss of indication of NI channels 1, 3 & 6. An ENS phone call was made at 0141 on 3\/22\/88. The plant Emergency Diesel Generator No.2 started as required with the expected loss of power to the #1-2400 volt and #4-480 volt busses following the turbine generator trip. The root cause of this event is the failure of one of two capacitors in the Sola Transformer. Both capacitors were replaced with direct replacements (in kind) which were dedicated in accordance with the plant Quality Assurance program. The NI channels were satisfactorily tested to the approved plant surveillance procedure. There was no adverse affect on the health or safety of the public as a result of this event. Similarly, but not reportable, a capacitor in the Sola transformer failed in 1985 and subsequently was replaced during testing in 1985. The replacement capacitors were of a different manufacturer, since the original capacitor is no longer produced. This is the first reported event of this nature. No other corrective actions are deemed necessary at this time.",

Just prior to this event, loop No. 2 feedwater flow began oscillating and loop No. 4 feedwater flow started decreasing. As a result, the levels in No. 2 and 4 steam generators were decreasing rapidly towards the trip setpoint. The reactor scram and turbine trip occurred at 0529 hours. The NRC was notified via ENS at 0603 hours. As part of the emergency procedures, the operators restarted the feedwater pumps. All automatic safety systems functioned as designed and the plant responded as expected. The root cause of this event is the failure of the power supply for SG level control channels on No. 2 and 4 steam generators. Corrective action involved the replacement of the failed equipment. No other action is deemed necessary at this time. As a result of this event, there was no adverse effect to the public health or safety.

The loss of generator field excitation resulted from automatic tripping of the AC feed to the static exciter. The Harriman (Z-126) transmission line also deenergized during this event. Loss of both generator excitation and one of two transmission lines resulted in a loss of flow from three of four main coolant pumps (MCPs). The operators secured MCP #1 approximately two minutes after plant trip and established natural circulation. By 2330 hours the Z-126 line had been re-energized. By 2345 hours the electrical busses had been cross-tied and restart of the MCPs had commenced. At 0005 hours, 18 May 1988, all four MCPs were operating. All automatic safety systems functioned as designed: the plant emergency diesel generators No 2 and 3 started as required. The root cause of this event was a failure of the Field Overvoltage Protection unit circuit board. Corrective action involves implementing a plant design change that will modify the static exciter's internal control and 2400V feeder circuit breaker control.

    "text": "On April 6, 1989 at 1123 hours with the plant at 100% power, the reactor was manually tripped when Number 1 Main Steam Line Isolation Valve (MSLIV) was inadvertently closed during a routine surveillance test of the MSLIV automatic control system. The manual trip was initiated, as required by procedure, to prevent a possible challenge to the Main Steam Line Safety Valves on Number 1 Steam Line. Full closure of the valve occurred when Instrumentation and Control personnel performing the control system functional test missed a procedure step. The missed step requires the insertion and removal of a test plug into a test jack terminal to block a trip signal prior to operating the valve control switch. If this step had been completed prior to operating the control switch, the valve would not have closed. After the plant trip, all plant systems functioned as designed. The root cause of the event has been attributed to personnel error in that the technician performing the procedure missed a step. Corrective actions included counseling the technicians on the importance of following procedure steps as written, and understanding the expected results of each step prior to its' performance. All special surveillance procedures of this type will be reviewed for human factors considerations and revised as necessary to improve usability. This is the first event of this nature. There was no adverse effect on the, health and safety of the public as a result of this event.",

    "text": "On June 15, 1991, at 2350 hours, while in Mode 1 at 88% reactor power, a lightning strike resulted in destruction of a lightning arrestor on the No. 3 Station Service Transformer (SST) and flashover of an insulator on the Z-126 115 kV transmission line disconnect switch. As a result, all offsite AC power was lost, an automatic reactor scra and turbine trip occurred, and all three EDGs operated as designed. On June 16, 1991, at 0010 hours, an UNUSUAL EVENT (UE) was declared based on the loss of offsite power and a fire emergency (smoldering arrestor). At 0014 hours, one source of offsite power was restored. At 0130 hours, an ALERT was declared at the discretion of the Shift Supervisor. While attempting to normalize the emergency busses, an inadvertent SI actuation signal was initiated at 0155 hours. Following restoration of essential communication systems and plant equipment, the ALERT was de-escalated to an UE at 0450 hours. On June 17, 1991, the plant attained a cold shutdown condition at 0755 hours and the UE was terminated at 0925 hours. The root cause of this event has been attributed to lightning-induced transients. Immediate corrective actions involved repairing and testing of affected electrical and mechanical equipment and plant instrumentation, and returning normal and emergency communication equipment back to service. A Yankee Investigation Team was assembled to evaluate the event and develop immediate and long-term corrective actions. There was no adverse effect to the public health or safety.",

    "text": "Big Rock Point Technical Specifications require that during power operation a minimum of one recirculation loop be in service (Technical Specification 4.1.2(a)) at a flow of 6E6 pounds per hour (Technical Specification 5.2.1). On February 5, 1988 at 0816 hours, both (2) recirculation pumps tripped as designed, during a momentary loss of station power (three seconds). Per procedure, plant operators tripped the reactor manually in response to the loss of recirculation flow and all control rods withdrawn successfully inserted. No other engineered safety features were challenged by the event. Reactor power was approximately 10 percent at the time of the trip. The momentary loss of station power occurred when the 138kV transmission tie breaker tripped during main generator synchronization. The breaker trip was caused when the plant operator attempted to close the main generator breaker slightly out of phase with the load. Following check-out of all associated equipment (relays, breakers, transformer), no equipment problems were identified and restart commenced on February 7, 1988. To prevent recurrence a training memo was developed to discuss the event, system operation, and proper method of synchronization with all plant operators.",

    "text": "On October 28, 1988 at 1630 hours, control room alarms indicated that a load rejection occurred due to loss of the transmission line. The turbine bypass valve opened to control reactor pressure and the turbine runback feature actuated, however, within 10 seconds a reactor and turbine trip occurred on low condenser vacuum due to large amount of steam flow into the condenser from the bypass valve. All control rods inserted following trip initiation. The turbine trip resulted in a momentary loss of station power for less than 5 seconds until automatic transfer to the backup offsite power source was completed. During this transition the Control Rod Drive M\/G set failed to transfer causing a loss of position indication until operators reclosed the normal supply breaker. All other systems functioned properly. Subsequent investigation showed the cause of the load rejection was a lightning rod which broke off during high winds and caused a fault on the transmission line approximately 10 miles from the plant site. Following check-out of the transmission line, repair of the M\/G set, and testing the plant was returned to service on October 29, 1988.",

    "text": "On August 22, 1989 the unit was operating at approximately 74 percent power following start-up from the Refueling Outage a week earlier. At 0635 hours, Operators noticed a slow reactor pressure increase and adjusted the Initial Pressure Regulator to restore pressure to normal. At 0645 hours, reactor pressure increased rapidly causing a reactor trip on High Neutron Flux. All control rods inserted and plant cooling was maintained with the main condenser. No Engineered Safety Systems other than the Reactor Protection System were actuated during the event. Cause of the trip was a rapid closure of the turbine admission valves due to gross leakage in the Turbine Initial Pressure Regulator bellows assembly. After repair of the bellows assembly and successful testing, the plant was restarted on August 22, 1989 at 2211 hours.",

    "text": "On May 13, 1992, the plant was starting up after a refueling outage. At 1224 the operators were testing the Turbine Stop Valve, and experienced difficulty in getting the valve to open fully. The turbine bypass valve was placed in manual and opened at 1353, reducing the delta P across the turbine stop valve. At 1401 the turbine stop valve opened. The turbine bypass valve was then given a partial close signal as the turbine stop valve opened, and at 1401 the reactor scrammed on short reactor period detected by two out of three wide range neutron monitors. The cause of the event has been attributed to opening the turbine bypass valve to reduce reactor pressure at low power levels. This action lowered reactor power from roughly 1.5% to a level just below 1% power which enabled short period scram protection. The root causes that led to operating the valve in this range can be attributed to not recognizing the sensitivity of the nuclear instrumentation below 1% power, lack of written precautions or warnings operating the bypass valve in this power range and undersized steam flow pilot holes internal to the turbine stop valve. The pilot holes' size was increased, the turbine stop valve was reassembled, and successfully tested at 2329 on May 16 during a subsequent plant startup. Operator training and appropriate procedure revisions will be completed.",

    "text": "On June 3, 1992 plant operations were normal. At 0533, the reactor scrammed on high flux due to a sudden spike in reactor pressure from 1335 psig to 1360 psig. All control rods inserted fully and no other engineered safeguards equipment was challenged, however contrary to design, the turbine did not trip and the Generator Output Breaker did not open. The root cause of the reactor scram has been determined to be an IPR bellows failure due to a weld defect combined with normal operating mechanical, cyclic stresses. Hand Trip Solenoid Binding is the most likely root cause of the failure of the turbine to trip. The facility was returned to operation on June 7, 1992. The IPR bellows was replaced with a spare, and the H nd Trip Solenoid was disassembled, inspected and tested successfully before re-installation. Long term evaluations will be performed to address upgrading the current IPR and Hand Trip Solenoid designs.",

    "text": "On October 29, 1992 at 1111, the facility experienced a momentary interuption of station power. The main transformer protective relay operated, tripping the 138 kV tie breaker and the generator output breaker. Station Power was automatically transfered from the 138 kV line to the 46 kV line. Consequently the turbine was automatically tripped. The reactor was also manually scrammed at 1112. An Unusual Event (UE) was conservatively declared at 1135. The UE was exited at 1426. Upon investigation, a loose connection was discovered in the current transformer terminal block of the 138 kV tie breaker. This resulted in thermal damage and separation of one of the inputs to the protective relays causing a false differential condition. The terminal block was repaired and tested. The normal lineup for station power was restored on October 30, 1992. Containment pipeway coolers that exhibited leakage during the event were repaired and returned to service. Following an evaluation of a high differential temperature condition on the reactor vessel, the Plant was returned to power operation on November 2, 1992.",

    "text": "On September 30, 1994, the reactor was manually scrammed at 2146 from 69% power during a planned facility shutdown for the 1994 Refueling Outage. Cooldown rate and temperature spreads between primary system equipment were maintained in accordance with Technical Specifications. The turbine generator (T\/G) controls were not operating smoothly, causing uncontrolled variances in reactor pressure control. (These oscillations had been experienced late in the operating cycle, and were exacerbated during the shutdown). Plant management deliberated for several hours on how to lower power with erratic T\/G controls, and decided that a manual scram would be the preferred method. Following the manual scram, the plant equipment operated as expected. The root cause of the erratic T\/G controls was the binding of the admission valve operating piston pilot valve extension rod in its guide bushing. The extension rod and the guide bushing were cleaned and dimensional checks performed to obtain clearance information. Prior to returning to service, the system will be tested-to ensure performance.",

In addition, the second condensate pump was being returned to service following the replacement of a mechanical seal. At 1530, the reactor was manually scrammed from about 54% power due to loss of suction pressure to the only operating feedwater pump. While filling and venting the condensate pump prior to operating, air was drawn through the common vent line to the operating condensate pump and discharged to the operating feedwater pump. All of the rods inserted and the plant functioned as designed. An Administrative cooldown limit for the Steam Drum was briefly exceeded, however an evaluation confirmed that engineering design limits were well within the specified parameters. The loss of feedwater was caused by a procedure that had never been validated for the rare operating condition of returning a condensate pump to service during power operation after it had been drained for maintenance. Corrective actions include procedure revision and validation for this operating condition.",

With the reactor power at approximately 22%, an automatic reactor scram occurred at 0315. The scram was automatically initiated (by the reactor protection system) due to a high rate of power change caused by excessive feedwater flow shortly after the controller had been switched from manual to automatic operation. The operators completed all scram actions, and established a primary system cooldown rate less than the 100 degrees F per hour required by Technical Specifications. The root cause of this event was failure to place the feedwater regulating valve in automatic using a bumpless transfer. Performance of multiple activities during plant startup contributed to the unsuccessful feedwater control transfer. Prior to restarting the facility, Operations' procedures O-TGS-1, Master Checklist, and Standard Operating Procedure 16, Feedwater System were revised to offer more guidance during this segment of plant startup. The facility was returned to service on November 17, 1995.",

    "text": "On September 16, 1996, @ 0251, Big Rock Point experienced an automatic reactor scram due to high reactor pressure. All systems operated as expected. The unit was in the process of being returned to service following a short forced outage prompted by a packing leak on a Reactor Depressurization System isolation valve. The initiator of this event has been attributed to the failure of the turbine Initial Pressure Regulator (IPR) bellows (the IPR maintains an essentially constant steam line pressure without regard to the generator or the transmission line system load). A crack had developed in the bellows, causing a loss of steam pressure and resulting closure of the turbine admission valves, causing the reactor pressure to increase beyond the high pressure scram setpoint. The root cause of the bellows failure was determined to be a lack of fusion defect on an inside weld bead. An IPR bellows with one operating cycle (about 12 months) of satisfactory performance has been installed in lieu of a new bellows, which would not be available for at least 10 weeks. The unit was then returned to service on September 17, 1996. To prevent future bellows failures, deficiencies in the vendor's fabrication process will be evaluated and corrected.",

    "text": "On December 7, 1996, @ 1210, Big Rock Point experienced an automatic reactor scram initiated by a turbine\/generator trip. The trip was caused by the inability of the Amplidyne voltage regulator to provide the necessary feedback control for the plant generator excitation circuitry. A resistor failed within the associated logic circuit. When the turbine tripped, the turbine stop valve closed, causing reactor power to increase beyond the high power scram setpoint, resulting in an automatic reactor scram. All systems operated as expected. The damaged Amplidyne voltage regulator resistor was replaced. The resistor failure was attributed to age degradation coupled with the effects of constant energizing and deenergizing of the unit (thermal expansion) of the wire wound wrap. Similar resistors associated with the Amplidyne voltage regulator will be replaced during the next refueling outage.",

    "text": "On July 24, 1989, at 1216 while at 76% power, Unit 1 was manually tripped due to a loss of feedwater flow to Steam Generator (SG) \"A\" and resultant low level. The loss of feedwater flow occurred during performance of a test of the SG \"A\" high level alarm. At 1215, operators authorized maintenance technicians to perform testing of the SG \"A\" high level alarm and Steam Flow\/Feed Flow Mismatch Reactor Trip alarm. During the high level alarm portion of the test, the SG \"A\" high level alarm annunciated as anticipated. The high level alarm was promptly followed by the SG \"A\" Steam\/Feed Mismatch alarm, which was not anticipated at this point in the test sequence. After observing that SG \"A\" levels were rapidly decreasing and the SG \"A\" main feedwater Flow Control Valve (FCV) had tripped closed, operators unsuccessfully attempted to open the FCV and, in accordance with procedures, manually tripped the reactor. SG \"A\" may have dried out for a brief period shortly after the reactor had been tripped until the auxiliary feedwater system actuated at 1217. All required systems functioned normally. The effects of a recent design change on the FCV circuitry were not recognized to result in a loss of feedwater flow and were, therefore, not transferred into station procedures or operator training. The root cause is attributed to weaknesses in SCE's processes for ensuring that design change information is adequately incorporated into procedures. The methods by which design change information is prepared and reviewed for incorporation into Station Procedures will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary group to determine appropriate enhancements and corrective actions necessary to assure recognition of impacts. The SG high level alarm test will be performed only while the unit is shutdown. Other recent design changes were reviewed for similar discrepancies with none being found.",

All systems responded normally to the trip and the operators (utility, licensed) stabilized the plant in Mode 3. The RPS operated in accordance with design, with no malfunctions noted. The brief low RCS flow signal occurred in Loop C and was caused by a loss of insulation resistance of the flow transmitter cable. The loss of insulation resistance resulted from time-temperature-radiation exposure degradation of the polyethylene insulation which has occurred since installation of the cable during original construction (i.e., prior to 1968). As corrective action, the cable was replaced and the RCS Loop C flow instrument was verified to be operating properly. The remaining two RCS loop flow instrumentation cables were tested and were found to be satisfactory. The RCS loop flow instrumentation cabling and the remaining cabling having the same insulation, which remain in service in important-to-safety applications, are not required to be Environmentally Qualified (EQ). The remaining cables having similiar insulation will be periodically tested for insulation degradation. A sample of these cables will be removed from service during the next refueling outage and replaced. The cables in the sample will be examined for indication of insulation degradation. Appropriate corrective actions will be developed based on the examination results.",

All systems responded normally to the trip and the operators stabilized the plant in Mode 3. The RPS operated in accordance with design with no malfunctions noted; therefore there was no safety significance to this event. The root cause of this event is believed to be the existence of voids in the loop B RCS flow transmitter coil insulation, which caused a ground in the coil. It has been determined that the voids were due to an isolated manufacturing defect. SCE believes that the ground in the flow transmitter coil caused the instrument loop to be sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields adjacent to the instrument loop cables. The occurrence of a magnetic field, which could be caused by the normal operation of plant equipment, near the flow transmitter signal cable (or a steady magnetic field if the ground was intermittent) could have produced a noise pulse large enough and of sufficient duration to cause an induced current in the flow instrumentation circuit sufficient t actuate the low flow trip signal, thereby causing the reactor trip. Corrective actions included replacement of the defective transmitter and verifying that all RCS loop flow instruments were operating properly.",

    "text": "On May 15, 1990, at 0243 with Unit 1 at 91.5% power, the reactor was manually tripped due to a low and decreasing level in Steam Generator (SG) C resulting from a loss of feedwater flow. The loss of feedwater flow occurred during maintenance on an Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pump while de-terminating a valve control circuit which resulted in an inadvertent short circuit to ground. The short circuit initiated automatic transfer of a vital bus and a momentary power interruption to the SG C high level actuation which, in turn, initiated closure of SG C main feedwater control valve (FCV). The high level actuation circuitry reset when it was re-energized at the completion of the transfer. The control room operator then reset the FCV controls in order to gain manual control of the FCV in accordance with procedures. However, the control operator was unable to re-establish feedwater flow before SG C reached the level at which procedures require the reactor to be tripped. Closure of the FCV resulted from a relay\/bistable race which occurred when the SG C high level FCV closure circuitry was re-energized. The potential for this interaction was not previously recognized. Corrective actions include: 1) temporarily disabling the SG high level closure of the FCV, 2) testing of the vital buses which are susceptible to brief power interruptions revealed no other unacceptable interactions, and 3) performance of a human performance enhancement system investigation into the cause of the short circuit is in progress.",

    "text": "At 2343 on 5\/28\/91, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 91% power, two of the 12 Control Bank 1 control rods (CRs) (H-6 and H-10) dropped into the core. Appropriate control room alarms were received and operators confirmed negative reactivity insertion per procedures. Operators properly responded (within 20 seconds) by manually tripping the reactor. At 2344, the auxiliary feedwater (AFW) system actuated on low steam generator (SG) water level which occurred due to expected SG water level shrinkage. At 0044 on 5\/29\/91, the reactor trip response procedure was exited with the plant stabilized in Mode 3. The CRs dropped as a result of an open connection in the \"half-voltage\" resistor network associated with this rod subgroup. The open connection de-energized the moveable gripper coils associated with the affected rods, thus permitting them to drop into the core. The open connection was caused by a conductor\/lug (jumper) connection failure at one termination point. Destructive physical analysis has revealed that the open connection resulted from long-term localized heating resulting in oxidation of the copper wire in the vicinity of the failure site. Continued heating led to arcing, melting, and eventual failure. The failed jumper was replaced with in-kind parts. In addition, other jumper wires\/lugs within the CR \"half power\" resistor bank were replaced in-kind. A continuity check and thermographic inspection were performed and no anomalous conditions were identified. Rod position indication and control rod drive operability tests were completed satisfactorily prior to startup.",

    "text": "At 1314 on 10\/17\/91, during the performance of corrective maintenance on an alarm module powered from Vital Bus No. 1 (VB1), and with a pre-existing failure of the high startup rate (SUR) block relay (AP4D), Unit 1 automatically tripped from 91% power on a spurious high SUR signal. The spurious SUR signal was generated when a momentary power interruption to VB1 occurred during an automatic transfer of VB1 to its alternate power source, which was initiated due to a momentary ground fault on the bus. As a taped alarm module power lead was being routed through a grooming hole in the module chassis, the lead arced apparently through the tape to the module chassis, causing the ground. The reactor protection system (RPS) and automatic control systems functioned as designed, and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3 at 1342. An auxiliary feedwater (AFW) actuation occurred due to the expected decrease in steam generator levels following the trip. All AFW components responded in accordance with design, and the AFW actuation was reset at 1401. Laboratory analysis of the taped lead revealed that the insulating capability of the tape had apparently been degraded during handling. This is postulated to have occurred when the taped lead contacted a sharp edge of the grooming hole on the alarm module chassis when the lead was inserted through the hole. The methodology used to route insulated live leads will be reviewed. Any methodology enhancements identified by this review will be implemented as appropriate. There is no safety significance to this event since all RPS and AFW components actuated in accordance with design.",

This event also resulted in automatic actuation of the auxiliary feedwater system. Subsequent disassembly and inspection of the valve revealed that the plug had separated from the valve stem. It was also noted that fragments of the valve stem were carried downstream in the feedwater system. An engineering evaluation determined that the loose parts were not a concern for one operating cycle. The root cause was improper part fabrication at the factory. Corrective action consisted of modifying the stem plug assemblies on all four feedwater regulating valves with a welded joint where the plug attaches to the stem.

A load reduction was commenced at 0833 however, at 0907, at approximately 50 percent power, a manual reactor trip was initiated, with subsequent shutdown of the RCP, when bearing temperatures reached 200 degrees F. Immediately following the trip the No.1 feedwater regulating valve failed to close resulting in actuation of the steam generator overfill protection system which closed the feedwater regulating valve and its associated motor operated isolation valve. In addition, one of the main steam safety pilot valves appeared to be simmering. At 0956 a heat detector near #3 RCP alarmed. At 1004 a fire was observed on the pump's insulation. The fire brigade entered the containment and at 1010 the fire was extinguished. cracked PVC coupling on the line leading from the #3 RCP motor upper bearing oil reservoir to its lift oil pump. Corrective action consisted of redesigning the coupling and shimming the supports to eliminate stress. This supplemental report provides the results of the failure cause of the feedwater solenoid valves.",

At 0156 the 'B' main feed pump motor breaker tripped resulting in steam flow\/feed flow mismatch alarms on all four steam generators. At 0157 the operators manually tripped the reactor and turbine. Automatic initiation of the auxiliary feedwater system and the subsequent cooldown caused pressurizer level to decrease to less than 13 percent and safety injection was manually initiated. After restoring pressurizer level, safety injection was terminated at 0230 hours and the plant was stabilized in Mode 3 (hot standby). The cause of the event was degraded insulation in the main feed pump motor stator believed to be due to heat and the age and design of the motor. Corrective action consisted of installing a spare stator. In addition the 'A' main feed pump was tested and found satisfactory. At 0510, with the plant in Mode 3, operators failed to obtain a loop boron sample before restarting the No. 1 reactor coolant pump and opening the affected loop cold leg isolation valve which constituted a violation of the Technical Specifications. The cause was operator error. Corrective action consisted of discussing with the crew the need to follow the Technical Specification requirements for sampling.",

    "text": "On January 16, 1987, at 2018 hours, a high flux reactor scram occurred due to increased recirculation flow. At the time, \"E\" recirculation pump was undergoing testing which required starting the pump. The pump discharge valve had been closed, however, as the pump was started, recirculation flow increased resulting in an APRM high flux scram. The cause of this event is attributed to a partially open discharge valve. The root cause of the event was a low torque switch setting which controls the closing thrust of the discharge valve. Following the APRM high flux scram, a second scram occurred due to the slow response of the mechanical pressure regulator (MPR) which the operators were using to control reactor pressure following the first scram. The slow response of the MPR is attributed to a calibration error since the MPR rate adjustment had been set with the turbine cold. As operating temperature increased the MPR response rate decreased resulting in excessive opening of the turbine bypass valves. When the valves were closed, a reactor low water level scram occurred. The closing thrust of the \"E\" recirculation pump discharge valve was measured and the torque switch setting was raised to its proper value. Torque switch settings for the remaining four discharge valves will be similarly reset. In the interim, future valve closure will be verified by monitoring motor current, as a minimum, and valve closure time when possible. With regard to the MPR, future calibrations will include adjustments to account for the effects of operating temperature. A similar occurrence is described in LER 85-026.",

    "text": "On February 14, 1987, at approximately 1301 hours a reactor scram occurred as a result of a high reactor water level turbine trip. The high reactor water level was caused when a technician moved a control room panel wire harness which inadvertently disconnected the \"A\" feedwater flow signal wire. The Feedwater Level Control System responded to the apparent loss of \"A\" feedwater flow by automatically opening the Feedwater Regulating Valves (FRV). This raised reactor water level until the turbine tripped and the scram occurred. The root cause of this event was insufficient procedural controls over wire termination practices. On February 26, 1987, at 1200 hours, while conducting an inspection of wire terminations as a corrective action for the above event, a technician disturbed a loose wire de-energizing relays which were bypassing a protective function by design. This resulted in an automatic closure of the main steam isolation valves. The reactor was in the SHUTDOWN mode with reactor coolant temperature less than 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The root cause of this event was faulty wire installation either during plant construction or subsequent maintenance. Terminations in the control room, and others vital to safety and operation were inspected and tightened where necessary. Procedures will be revised to control future termination practices.",

    "text": "On July 30, 1987 at 0500 hours a high reactor pressure scram occurred when an air leak caused a Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) to close with reactor power greater than the level where one main steam line alone is sufficient to maintain reactor pressure below the scram setpoint. The plant was operating at approximately 97% rated power prior to this event with reactor pressure at 1020 psig and reactor temperature at 524 degrees F. During a 5% closure test of MSIV NS04A, the air test pilot valve partially dislodged from its mounting causing the MSIV to close beyond 5% and stabilize at an intermediate position. This produced a low control air pressure alarm. The operators quickly diagnosed the problem and began reducing power and started two additional air compressors. Fifteen minutes had elapsed and reactor power had been reduced to approximately 70% when the air test pilot valve dislodged completely closing the MSIV.  This caused a high reactor pressure scram. The cause of this event is the air test pilot valve mounting cap screws were 1\/4 inch shorter than vendor specifications. The dislodged air test pilot valve and all other MSIV air pilot valves were reinstalled with proper length cap screws. The MSIV air pilot valve installation procedure will be revised to identify the proper length screws for future maintenance.",

    "text": "On April 22, 1989 at 1850 hours, the mechanical vacuum pump was placed into service in order to maintain condenser vacuum during a planned shutdown evolution. The equipment operator who placed the vacuum pump into service failed to properly align the seal water makeup supply. At 1935 hours a gradual decrease in the main condenser vacuum was noted. The rate of decrease in condenser vacuum prevented any significant attempts to correct the problem so the Group Shift Supervisor directed. the operators to manually scram the reactor at 1945 hours. The cause of this occurrence is attributed to operator error. The operator failed to establish a complete valve lineup to the seal water makeup supply in accordance with the operating procedure. Starting the mechanical vacuum pump is a simple evolution but infrequently performed by individual operators. Operators are not required to have a procedure in hand when performing a simple or routine evolution. This contributed to the oversight by the operator. Without seal water makeup the mechanical vacuum pump operated properly until the seal water tank emptied which then caused a significant air leak to the main condensers. This caused the decrease in condenser vacuum which resulted in the reactor scram. The safety significance of this event is minimal because the reactor was at low power (approximately 2%) when the event occurred. To prevent a similar occurrence in the future, other infrequently performed evolutions that currently do not require a procedure in hand will be reviewed to determine if further guidance is warranted.",

    "text": "On May 18, 1989 at 1103 hours the reactor automatically shut down due to a trip of the main turbine generator. An instrument technician had been assigned the task of calibrating the plant megavar recorder. He discussed the activity with shift management but did not mention that input leads to the recorder would be disconnected. The technician started the evolution an hour and a half later without informing the Control Room. Upon disconnecting the input leads to the recorder, a Hi\/Low VAR alarm was received. The operators did not realize that the alarm was the result of the technician's work and attempted to manually restore the VAR loading. The operator did not realize that he was actually increasing megavars because he was not observing bus voltages, which were increasing. A generator overexcitation condition resulted which tripped the main generator, caused a reactor scram, and resulted in a fast start of both diesel generators. The operators proceeded to cooldown the plant with the Isolation Condensers until the Shutdown Cooling System was placed into service at 1523 hours. The plant reached cold shutdown conditions at approximately 1700 hours. The root cause of this event was personnel error on the part of both operations and maintenance personnel. To prevent a recurrence of a similar event, administrative controls have been implemented and increased emphasis has been placed on communications between the work group and the control room. Operators will be briefed on the need to use all available indications during a response to an abnormal condition to avoid a recurrence of this event.",

The entire Electrical system was evaluated for adverse effects due to the fault, and an evaluation was completed to determine if a generic problem existed between the two failed transformers and the other power transformers at the station. As a result, it was determined the failure was confined to the two main output transformers and did not involve any other transformers.

    "text": "On September 22, 1989, at approximately 1418 hours, mechanical test equipment was inadvertently left connected to one of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) water level instruments after testing was complete. While being placed back in service, the reference leg of the instrument was vented to the test equipment causing a false high RPV water level signal to be generated in all five level instruments attached to that common reference leg. The false high RPV water level caused a trip of the turbine generator which resulted in a reactor scram. The technician performing the valve manipulation recognized the problem and closed the root valve. The cause of this event was personnel error since the test equipment was not removed as required by the surveillance procedure. This event had minimal safety significance because the Reactor Protection System is designed to protect the reactor from any turbine trip condition, and the excess flow check valves in the instrument line would have prevented any significant loss of coolant. All engineered safety features would have functioned normally due to redundant RPV level instrumentation. All instruments involved in this event were calibration checked to ensure no problems had resulted from the momentary depressurization. The technicians involved in this event were counseled.",

    "text": "On February 20, 1990, while performing a surveillance on a reactor vessel level instrument, an Instrument & Controls (I&C) technician keyed a hand-held radio near the analog trip units for the Alternate Rod Injection (ARI) System causing the system to actuate due to radio frequency interference (RFI). Control room operators noted that air operated valves supplied from the Scram Air System were repositioning and that control rods were drifting into the core. The operators initiated a manual reactor scram as required by procedure due to the drifting control rods. The cause of this occurrence has been attributed to personnel error by the technician performing the surveillance procedure. The access door to the area where the ARI System components are located is well marked with reference to the restriction on the use of radios in the area. This event is determined to have minimal safety significance because a manual scram was initiated by the operators within 5 seconds of rod movement. Chemistry samples indicate that no fuel damage resulted from this event. The use of radios by I&C technicians must now be approved by the technician's supervisor. Appropriate site personnel will receive training on this event and an investigation will be conducted into minimizing the ARI System's sensitivity to RFI.",

Several safety related components were affected by the loss of power. and drywell unidentified leak rate increased to greater than 5 gpm due to loss of power to the Drywell Equipment Drain Tank Pump Control Circuit. The plant was shutdown due to loss-of-power to required electrical busses, and on April 22nd at 1005 hours, the reactor reached cold shutdown. USS 1B2 was isolated from the failed supply cable and reenergized from USS 1A2 via the crossconnect breaker. During the cooldown, the A isolation condenser was declared inoperable due to the inability to electrically cycle a DC isolation valve because of thermal binding. This thermal binding problem was corrected by modifications completed during the 13R refueling outage. The cause of the cable failure was determined to be a 'void' in the insulation of the cable. A new supply cable was installed and the USS was repowered from it's normal source. A representative sample of other cables supplying safety related components were tested, and no generic concerns were found. On March 22, 1991, the 1A2 cable failed during the 13R outage. There appears to be no connection between the failures of these two cables.",

    "text": "On August 22, 1991, at 0306 hours, a reactor scram occurred due to low reactor water level. The cause of the low reactor water level was a loss of feedwater flow due to a main feed pump trip on low suction pressure. The root cause of this event was a grounded condensate pump motor which led to a condensate pump trip while the plant was operating above 80% power. The motor was replaced. The shrink in reactor water level caused by the scram and the reduction in feedwater flow caused reactor water level to reach the double low Reactor Protection System (RPS) setpoint which actuated appropriate Engineered Safety Features. A second event being reported is a procedure violation which occurred at 1012 hours. While plant cooldown to cold shutdown conditions was in progress, all five reactor recirculation discharge valves were shut simultaneously with reactor temperature above 212 degrees F. The plant achieved cold shutdown at approximately 1800 hours.",

    "text": "A reactor scram and subsequent Engineered Safety Features systems actuations were caused by a turbine load rejection due to faults on off-site 230kV transmission lines caused by a forest fire. The scram occurred at 1326 hours on May 3, 1992 and the event concluded at 0635 hours on May 4, 1992. The reactor was operating at approximately 100% power before the scram. Numerous other engineered safety features actuated including Isolation Condensers, Containment Isolation, Diesel Generator fast start, Core Spray and Standby Gas Treatment. Several additional scram signals occurred in the process of bringing the plant to cold shutdown and returning power supplies to off-site sources. An Unusual Event was declared based on high drywell temperature, and an Alert was declared based on the potential of the forest fire to further affect the plant. The plant was brought to cold shutdown at 2234 hours on May 3, and the emergency condition was terminated at 0635 hours on May 4, after off-site power was restored to vital electrical buses. Off-site power had been available since 1331 hours on May 3, but plant management decided not to place the vital buses on off-site power until reliability could be assured. No plant structures or equipment were damaged by the fire. The forest fire which caused the loss of off-site power was the root cause of the event, and the safety significance was minimal because all systems functioned as required. Corrective actions include a revision to the Diesel Generator operating procedure to prevent an avoidable scram when securing diesel generator operation. Utility personnel inspected off-site power lines and found no damage. High resistance contacts on the control rod drive pump time delay relay were replaced due to the pump's failure to start on a diesel generator load sequence.",

    "text": "A reactor low water level scram from full power occurred on August 22, 1992, at 1255 hours. A low-low water level condition occurred immediately after the scram, which resulted in the actuation of several engineered safety features: Core Spray system initiation, Diesel Generator start, primary containment isolation, main steam isolation, Isolation Condenser initiation, and Standby Gas Treatment system initiation. Once the Main Steam Isolation Valves were closed, reactor water level was restored using the Feedwater system. The reactor was cooled using the Isolation Condensers. The cause of the event was a failed proportional amplifier in the Feedwater Control system, which caused the system to sense a large decrease in steam removed from the reactor vessel. The system compensated for the apparent steam flow decrease by rapidly reducing Feedwater flow, which caused the low water level and scram. The safety significance of the event is considered minimal. The failed proportional amplifier was replaced and the plant was restarted. The Feedwater Control system is scheduled to be replaced in the upcoming refueling outage.",

    "text": "On 12\/18\/95 at 0437 hours a reactor scram and turbine trip occurred due to high reactor pressure. The cause of the event was a generator runback due to high stator cooling water temperature. The elevated cooling water temperature was caused by the failure of the system temperature control valve to properly regulate cooling water temperature. When cooling water temperature reached the high temperature setpoint of 89 Degrees C, the generator protection system initiated a turbine generator runback. The closing of the turbine control valves beyond the limit of the bypass valves reduced the mass flow capability of the turbine control system and reactor pressure increased. When reactor pressure reached the high pressure scram setpoint of 1045 psig, a reactor scram occurred as designed. Reactor power peaked at 108.5 % power during the pressure transient. After the scram, reactor water level dropped below the low level scram setpoint (139.48 in. TAF) to a level of 97 in. TAF and then was recovered in accordance with plant procedures. The faulty temperature control valve was repaired and the stator cooling system was returned to operational status.",

When reactor level decreased to 139 inches above Top of Active Fuel (TAF), a Low Level reactor scram occurred as designed. Following the scram, water level further decreased to approximately 120 inches TAF before being restored to normal. The cause of the event was a failure on the part of the operator to properly control reactor water level, aggressively take action to restore level, and use the most conservative reactor water level indicator. A contributory cause was ineffective supervisory oversight in that two SRO licensed supervisors did not take positive action to halt startup activities until normal level control could be reestablished. The safety significance of this event was minimal. Adequate core cooling was maintained. Immediate corrective action was taken to recover water level and place the reactor in a shutdown condition. A discussion of the event was issued to the operators. Guidance was issued to the operators on reactor water level control, and use of the most conservative level indicator during a reactor startup. Additional long term corrective action will be taken to evaluate the transition point for feedwater control during a reactor start up.",

Several engineered safety features actuated. The two control rod drive pumps failed to start as designed.

With vacuum decreasing rapidly and approaching the low vacuum scram setpoint, the operators manually scrammed the reactor in accordance with station procedures. Plant response to the scram was normal and there were no unexpected activations of or challenges to engineered safety features. The cause was failure of the solenoid operated valves (SOVs) associated with the SJAE steam supply valves. The SOVs failed because they were not temperature rated for the environment in which they were located. The root cause was inappropriate replacement of direct acting solenoid valves with pilot operated valves with elastomer material not rated for the environmental conditions.  Immediate corrective action was taken to stabilize the plant and subsequently place the reactor in cold shutdown mode.  A detailed root cause and extent review was conducted by engineering. Prior to restart, the SOVs were replaced with valves rated for the environment.  Additional guidance will be developed for the design, procurement and installation of SOVs.",

    "text": "On November 15, 2000, during reactor startup from the 18 R outage, turbine pre-warming had been completed and Operators were transitioning to steam chest warming in accordance with procedures. Reactor Pressure was approximately 460 psig. Due to a misinterpretation of the procedure, the operators did not close the Bypass Valve Opening Jack prior to closing the Load Limiter. This resulted in several Turbine Bypass Valves (BPVs) rapidly opening and a subsequent reactor level increase. Immediate response to the high level condition was to reduce feedwater flow and increase letdown. This action combined with the inventory loss through the BPVs resulted in overcompensating and the level decreased to the low-level scram setpoint. A full reactor scram was received. All control rods inserted. Reactor level was stabilized. Reactor pressure continued to decrease until the bypass valves were shut (approximately 17 minutes into the transient).  The main consequence of this transient was the scram, which resulted in the excessive cooldown rate, and exceeded the 100 degrees F per hour Technical Specification limit.  The root cause of this event was personnel error. Operators demonstrated a lack of fundamental knowledge with respect to system operations in that they did not fully comprehend the consequences of not closing the bypass valve opening jack prior to closing the limit load and failed to close the BPVs.  Corrective actions included revising the procedure to clarify the misinterpreted step. An evaluation of the effects of excessive cool down rate was also conducted.",

The spurious actuation was caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI). The reactor shut down as designed.  The safety significance of this event is considered minimal. The plant responded as designed for this type of event. Technical Specification limits were maintained. There was no radioactive release. All safety systems were fully operable. Off-site power was available. Operator performance was satisfactory.  A Root Cause Analysis has been completed identifying the root cause of the EMI induced spiking of the IRM channels. IRM-13 & 14 were found to have loose cable connections at the drawer and nicks in the outer surface of the cable. This has been traced as the entry point of the noise intrusion and the reason the channels spiked. A coated surface on the circuit preamplifier box, on IRM-1 8, caused a poor connection to a common ground point and provided another entry point for noise intrusion.  Connections were tightened, damaged cabling was repaired, and one IRM pre-amplifier was replaced.",

    "text": "On June 1, 2005, at 21:09, with Oyster Creek at 100% power, an Anticipatory Generator Load Reject scram occurred. During restoration of a transformer by the transmission utility at their substation, a failure of lightning arrestors resulted in a phase-to-phase-to-ground short circuit. This resulted in a grid transient of sufficient magnitude that the Oyster Creek Turbine-Generator sensed a load rejection condition, which resulted in a reactor scram signal. The reactor scrammed and the turbine-generator tripped as expected for this condition. All safety systems performed as expected. The plant was stabilized in the hot shutdown mode.  Corrective actions included completing restart required evaluations, testing and confirmation from the involved transmission utility that conditions in the substation would not result in recurrence of the grid disturbance.  The apparent cause of this event was equipment failure of the lightning arrestors in the transmission utility substation that created a grid disturbance.  There have been several grid disturbances over the life of the plant, including two LERs: LER 2003-003, Actuation of Reactor Protection System Due to a Grid Transient (August 14, 2003). LER 1994-007 was a reactor scram caused by a 230 KV bus section differential relay trip while a switchyard worker was installing a Digital Fault Recorder.",

The loss of cooling was caused by a faulted cooling bank motor starter, resulting in the failure of the MIA auxiliary control power transformer and subsequent loss of control power for the remaining cooling bank motor starters. A reactor load reduction was commenced in accordance with the alarm response procedure to maintain MIA temperatures below the alarm set points. While reactor power was being reduced, transformer operation was limited to 30 minutes without forced cooling. Operations secured the power reduction and manually scrammed the reactor from 74% power in accordance with plant procedures. The post scram response was normal and the required notifications were made. All safety systems operated as expected following the reactor scram. There were no safety consequences impacting plant or public safety as a result of this event. This event is being reported pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to manual actuation of the reactor protection system.",

These lightning strikes in conjunction with a failure of a line breaker to open caused grid disturbances, a main generator trip on over-excitation, an automatic reactor scram due to the load rejection, and a loss of offsite power to the Startup Transformers.  When the plant experienced the loss of offsite power to the Startup Transformers, both Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) started and energized their associated safety related buses. During the event, EDG #1 was slow to tie onto its safety-related bus and the erratic \"B\" Isolation Condenser (IC) level indication resulted in operators declaring the IC inoperable. An Unusual Event was declared for the loss of power to the Startup Transformers for greater than 15 minutes. All declarations and notifications were made correctly and in a timely manner.  This event is being reported pursuant to: 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to automatic actuation of the reactor protection system, isolation condensers, and emergency diesel generators; and 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) due to loss of offsite power to the Startup Transformers.",
