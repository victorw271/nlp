    "text": "On 4\/23\/89 at 1830 hours, during normal steady state operation, (Mode 1, at 100 percent power) the Control Room Operator observed that Group C control rods could not be moved. The operating crew determined that the control rods' cam motor was inoperable. An electrician was called in. The electrician performing troubleshooting requested the control room operator withdraw the group one step for troubleshooting purposes. The cam motor and control rods appeared to operate properly while being pulled one step. Almost immediately the control room received indication of dropped rods. Within five to ten seconds after the rods dropped an automatic scram occurred as a result of low main coolant pressure. An Unusual Event was declared at 1910 hours and terminated at 1915 hours. NRC notification was made at 1938 hours. A thorough investigation was conducted determine the cause of the dropped rods. The cause of the inoperable cam motor was attributed to a broken compression connector found on the motor's brake solenoid circuit. The connector was replaced in kind. No abnormalities were found during the inspection or testing of the control rods' circuits and components. Control rod exercising was performed without abnormal indications. A root cause for this event could not be positively determined. There was no adverse effect to the public health or safety as a result of this event.",

    "text": "On 12\/5\/90, at 0702 hours, with the plant in Mode 1 at 100% power, following performance of valving to support repair of a control air leak, an automatic reactor scram occurred. Closure of a control air isolation valve (CA-V-1239) resulted in an unanticipated loss of air to the Heater Drain Tank High Level Dump Valve causing it to open. This resulted in sequential automatic tripping of the Heater Drain Pump on low Heater Drain Tank level and the Boiler Feed Pumps (BFPs) on low suction pressure. The loss of feedwater flow from the BFPs resulted in a low level condition in the steam generat rs which initiated the automatic reactor scram. The root cause of this event has been-attributed to personnel error. An incomplete notation on a plant drawing and the valve identification tag contributed to the error. As corrective actions the drawing and valve tag have been corrected and a walkdown of the control air system drawings is in progress. All plant systems functioned as designed during the event. There was no adverse effect on the health or safety of the public as a result of this event.",

    "text": "At 1024 on March 10, 1987, with the Unit at 92% power, a trip signal initiated in response to a loss of generator field, resulted in a turbine trip and subsequent reactor trip. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically actuated on low steam generator level as expected from a trip at this power level. During the trip recovery, equipment deficiencies were noted which included: failure of two rod bottom indicating lights to illuminate; one of two intermediate range nuclear instrumentation channels failed off-scale low; eight Moisture Separator Reheater steam dump valves and their associated motor operated isolation valves failed to close, which in turn caused perforations in one of the Low Pressure turbine casing rupture discs; and, the main feedwater block valve to \"A\" Steam Generator failed to fully close upon demand. The loss of generator field was due to an electrical short resulting from a brush being inadvertently dropped into the main exciter commutator assembly during performance of routine brush replacement on the commutator and brush assemblies. Inadequate lighting within the commutator enclosure was a contributing factor since the electrician held a flashlight in one hand while replacing the brush with the other, thereby limiting his dexterity. Enhancements to the available lighting within the commutator enclosure have been completed. Additionally, this incident has been discussed with all electricians who may be involved in similar work. Since none of the equipment failures resulted in a loss of safety function, there were no safety consequences to this event.",

When the operators transferred the 4160 volt electrical power supply to reactor coolant pump bus 1-1A from offsite power to the main generator, circuit breaker 3T-1A opened however 309-1A failed to close. Subsequently, indicated reactor power exceeded the P-7 permissive enable setpoint while reactor coolant pumps 1 & 2 were de-energized. Before breaker 3T-1A could be reclosed, the 2 out of 4 reactor coolant low flow trip logic was satisfied and the reactor tripped. The cause of this event was equipment failure and a procedure deficiency. Immediate corrective actions consisted of a procedure revision to NOP 2.1-6 and the repair\/reinstallment of breaker 309-1A. This event is reportable under 10CFR50.73 (a) (2) (iv) since it resulted in an automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System.",

The scram was caused by the failure of the backwash outlet valve to open, causing a loss of circulating water to the A condenser. The backwash outlet valve failed to open due to a breaker trip of the motor operator. The plant was stabilized in a hot standby condition and subsequently taken to cold shutdown. The motor operator, the breaker and the valve were all inspected and tested satisfactorily. The auxiliary contacts on the motor close coil were replaced and auxiliary contacts on the motor open coil were realigned. The remaining 20 circulating water valves manipulated during backwashing evolutions were tested and verified to be operating properly.",

    "text": "On December 6, 1987, at approximately 2100 hours, Operations personnel at Nine Mile Point Unit 1 (NMP1) observed that the reactor feedwater flow control system began to develop an instability. Attempts were made to dampen the resulting reactor water level oscillations by taking local manual control of a feedwater flow control valve. However, these attempts were unsuccessful and the reactor scrammed at 0054 hours on December 7, when the water level fell to the low level scram setpoint. The High Pressure Coolant Injection mode of feedwater also initiated and reactor water level was subsequently restored to normal level. The probable root cause of this event was debris in the instrument air control line to the feedwater flow control valves #13 North and South and #11 valve positioners. A secondary cause of this event was the fact that the feedwater master controller was out of adjustment. This prevented the flow control valves from responding properly to signals from the feedwater control system.  Corrective actions consisted of issuing station Work Requests to repair the feedwater control malfunction, recalibrating the feedwater master controller and initiating a Modification Request to install inline filters on the instrument air supply to the Feedwater Flow Control Valves.",

    "text": "On August 19, 1990, with the reactor mode switch in the run position, reactor power at approximately 21.5 percent, Nine Mile Point Unit 1 (NMP1) experienced turbine vibration problems when conducting Power Ascension Procedure N1-PAT-12-1, \"Main Turbine-Generator Rotor System Torsional Screening Test\". The turbine was manually tripped, subsequently a manual reactor scram was inserted prior to breaking vacuum to preclude an automatic reactor scram on low condenser vacuum. Consequently, a High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) (mode of Feedwater control) signal was received due to low reactor water level (53 inches) and a main steam isolation valve isolation occurred on decreasing condenser vacuum (7 inches mercury Hg). A root cause investigation determined that the most likely cause of the Low Pressure (L.P.) turbine rotor vibration was that a slow acceleration rate through an L.P. turbine critical speed range led to the L.P. turbine rotor developing an interstage packing rub and bowed rotor. Immediate corrective action was to terminate N1-PAT-12-1. Additionally, revision to the turbine torsional test is being pursued by Engineering and General Electric to address the technical problems encountered during the initial run.",

Reactor pressure and water level were maintained using the electromatic relief valves (ERVs), emergency condensers, and the control rod drive injection system. At 1633 hours an Unusual Event (UE) was declared due to grid instability. After grid stability had been established the EDGs were secured. EDG 103 was secured at 2339 hours on August 14, 2003 and EDG 102 was secured at 0018 hours on August 15,2003. The UE was terminated at 0120 hours on August 15, 2003.  The cause of the event was the severe disturbance on the northeast electric grid.  This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) because of the critical reactor scram, and because of the automatic start of the EDGs.",

Efforts to manually stabilize feedwater flow were unsuccessful. At approximately 0833 hours, a manual scram was initiated to shutdown the plant.  The feedwater flow oscillations were caused by degradation of the #13 feedwater flow control valve positioner due to a ruptured diaphragm in the output pilot valve. The root cause was determined to be the original design did not adequately establish a service life that took into account operating the positioner at the maximum recommended air supply pressure, thereby decreasing the service life below the established preventive maintenance frequency.  The positioner, including the failed pneumatic module, for the #13 feedwater flow control valve was replaced. Subsequent testing demonstrated satisfactory flow control capabilities. To prevent recurrence, the positioner will be replaced every two years.",

    "text": "On August 18, 2005, at approximately 0950 hours, with Nine Mile Point Unit 1 operating at approximately. 100 percent power, an automatic reactor scram was experienced. The scram occurred when Power Board 11 (PB-11) was de-energized due to inadvertent protective over-current relay actuations. The resulting loss of power to the Channel 11 side of the Reactor Trip Bus (RTB), concurrent with planned in-progress surveillance testing that introduced a half-scram signal an the opposite (Channel 12) side of the RTB, caused a full automatic reactor scram signal to be generated.  PB-11 was de-energized due to inadvertent protective over-current relay actuations caused by mechanical jarring of the relays mounted on the cubicle door. This occurred when a 4.16 kV circuit breaker was being rolled into position within its PB-11 cubicle. The underlying cause of the event is failure to adequately identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks of conducting work. The potential plant impacts that could be caused by inadvertent actuation or damage to surrounding equipment due to planned work were not identified or effectively managed.  Corrective actions have been developed such that, when completed, the work control process will yield consistent and effective risk assessments of work activities that will prevent the same type of inadvertent relay actuation and other similar events (i.e., events caused by failure to identify and effectively manage potential risks associated with surrounding equipment).",

Valves 01-03 and 01-04 closed following receipt of an invalid low-low reactor water level signal.   The scram was the result of a combination of two latent preexisting plant conditions and performance of a quarterly instrument channel surveillance test. The first preexisting condition was misaligned connector pins on Grayboot splice connectors for outboard MSIV Channel 11 solenoid operated valves. The cause of the misalignment was determined to be insufficient rigor in the behaviors and knowledge (training) used in identifying appropriate post maintenance testing (PMT) requirements. The second preexisting condition was a misaligned contact spring in isolation logic Channel 12 relay 12K74 (General Electric (GE) Model CR305). The cause of this failure was excess material (plastic) left during fabrication of the relay's movable contact holder.   Immediate actions were to repair the Channel 11 Grayboot splice connectors and replace Channel 12 relay 12K74. Training will be provided to planning personnel to ensure an adequate understanding of complex\/redundant circuits for the proper determination of PMT requirements. Procedure\/manuals governing Grayboot connector maintenance activities will be revised to include additional post assembly inspections and testing.",

    "text": "On October 29, 2012 at 21:00:57 hours, Nine Mile Point Unit 1 (NMP1) experienced an unplanned, automatic, reactor scram due to a Turbine Trip from 100 percent power caused by activation of a generator lockout relay. The generator trip was an unexpected consequence and was initiated by a high fault current condition in the Scriba switchyard detected by both NMP1 instantaneous ground directional overcurrent relays. A polarity wiring error within the generator step up transformer neutral ground current transformers (CTs) caused the relay protection circuits to actuate on the fault in the Scriba switchyard. This was not expected because the relay protection circuits were designed to detect a fault condition between the main generator and the station output breakers. The error was caused by less than adequate oversight by CENG personnel of transformer XF-TB01 testing with respect to unclear specificity of requirements for vendor performed testing and inadequate methods of verification for ensuring vendor compliance with engineering specifications. This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an actuation of the reactor protection system and an actuation of the high pressure coolant injection system while the reactor was critical. Corrective actions include correcting the wiring of the CT circuits, verifying all the requirements in the engineering specification have been met, revising the associated electrical drawings, and revising engineering procedures to require the listing of critical attributes for equipment\/components and to define testing criteria\/verification methods to be performed when factory acceptance testing or modification functional testing cannot be performed to verify the functionality of equipment\/components.",

The reactor was subsequently manually scrammed from 87% power at 0116 hours. All Containment Cooling Service Water and Low Pressure Coolant Injection pumps were manually started for maximum suppression pool cooling. The maximum average cooldown rate when averaged over a one hour period reached 129.3 degrees F\/hr, and maximum bulk suppression chamber water temperature was 122 degrees F. The opening of the TRSRV was apparently caused by steam cuts on the first stage pilot valve disc. Analyses were performed to verify that the cooldown rate and the bulk suppression chamber temperature attained during this event were within design limits. A satisfactorily leak tested, rebuilt TRSRV was installed. The Technical Staff will monitor the TRSRV tail pipe temperatures to verify proper pilot valve operation. The Station will routinely replace the entire TRSRV at each refuel outage. A previous TRSRV failure event was reported by LER 50-237\/76-34.",

Feedwater regulating valves for 21, 22, 23, and 24 steam generators had been placed in manual prior to the trip due to inconsistent response experienced during the shutdown. Feedwater flow to the steam generators was being controlled primarily with 21 Main Boiler Feed Pump speed. 21 Main Boiler Feed Pump recirculation valve opened as designed on low flow, causing a reduction in feedwater to all steam generators. A manual turbine trip was initiated in accordance with management direction, which caused a further reduction in steam generator levels due to \"shrink.\" The combined effect of reduced feedwater flow and \"shrink\" resulted in a low steam generator level reactor trip. All control rods fully inserted and the generator tripped 30 seconds following the turbine trip as designed. Following the reactor trip all safety-related equipment performed as required with the exception of the 21, 22, and 24 Main and 23 Low-flow Feedwater Regulating Valves which did not fully close, as required. A multi-discipline team was promptly assembled to investigate the cause of the Main and Low-flow Feedwater Regulator valve non-closures. The reactor was safely brought to hot shutdown conditions.",

    "text": "On April 19, 2018, at 2100 hours, during initial plant startup following the Spring 2018 refueling outage (2R23), Indian Point Unit 2 commenced performance of the main turbine generator startup procedure to conduct turbine overspeed testing. At 2107 hours, the control room received main feedwater supervisory and panel alarms, and the main turbine control valves were observed to have opened rapidly. The unexpected rapid opening of the turbine control valves caused steam flow to increase, which in turn, caused all four steam generator water levels to swell. The high steam generator levels initiated an automatic main feedwater isolation and main turbine trip, with both Main Boiler Feedwater Pumps (MBFPs) tripping on closure of their discharge valves as part of the main feedwater isolation actuation. At 2108 hours, with reactor power at 8 percent and no MBFPs running, a manual reactor trip was inserted by the control board operators in accordance with the abnormal operating procedure for loss of main feedwater. All control rods fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by the main condenser. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) automatically started as expected on the tripping of the MBFPs to maintain steam generator inventory. The direct cause of the event was main turbine control oil stop valve LO-Z being out of its required position (closed instead of open). The root cause was main turbine generator startup procedure (2-SOP-26.4) provided a weak barrier to maintain the proper configuration of the main turbine control oil system. Corrective actions primarily involved the resolution of configuration control and management vulnerabilities. This event had no effect on the public health and safety. The event was reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on April 19, 2018 under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A).",

The fault ruptured the transformer tank releasing oil and caused a fire that damaged the transformer and adjacent equipment. At 0327, an Unusual Event was declared based on the fire in the plant protected area lasting longer than 10 minutes. The site fire brigade responded and extinguished the fire. Offsite fire fighting assistance was requested, but was not used to extinguish the fire. The fire was extinguished and the Unusual Event was terminated at 0500. All plant systems functioned as designed during and after the event. The operating crew controlled and stabilized the plant, and therefore the health and safety of the public was not adversely impacted by this event. The root cause for the Turkey Point Unit 4 Main Transformer failure was a failed manufacturing process employed by the vendor's supplier of the clamping ring. Corrective actions included replacement of the Main Transformer and repair\/replacement of components damaged by the resultant fire.",

    "text": "On June 13, 2011, Quad Cities Unit 1 was performing startup from refueling outage Q1R21. During power ascension while at 61% power (560 MWe) a steam leak was identified on the main steam line downstream of turbine control valve #1 (1-5699-CV1). Reactor power was reduced and the reactor was manually scrammed. The steam leak occurred at a recently repaired sensing line that had previously leaked. A forced outage was initiated to investigate and performs repairs.  The reactor and turbine responded as designed. Operators performed required actions safely and in accordance with procedures and training. There were no complications during the reactor scram and turbine trip, and all systems functioned as required.  The root cause for the manual scram due to a steam leak from a pressure sensing line repair was that the capped pipe stub repair failed due to a fatigue induced flaw that was not known to exist at the time of the repair. Corrective actions included replacing the Unit 1 sensing line sock-o-lets with gamma plugs. Future corrective actions include replacement of the equivalent Unit 2 sensing line sock-o-lets with gamma plugs.   The safety significance of this event was minimal. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of the reactor protection system (RPS), including reactor scram.",

A rapid plant down power was commenced following report of a fire in the vicinity of the P-2B condensate pump lower motor bearing. At 0718 hours, the reactor was manually tripped from approximately 95% power, in conjunction with securing the P-2B condensate pump, and the imminent loss of main feedwater. Following the reactor trip, the auxiliary feedwater system started automatically to maintain steam generator water level. The plant was stabilized in Mode 3. Overheating, and ultimately fire, at the condensate pump lower motor bearing were caused by pump and motor misalignment following maintenance in July 2004. The pump and motor misalignment occurred as a result of inadequate maintenance instructions. Proper alignment criteria were established and incorporated into the work instruction when the repaired motor was reinstalled in September 2004.  The safety significance of this event was minimal. All safety systems functioned as expected during the plant trip.  This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in a manual actuation of the reactor protection system and automatic actuation of the auxiliary feedwater system.",

Unit 3 was operating at 19 percent power to accommodate corrective maintenance to resolve a high vibration problem on the main turbine. The root cause of the trip was that the downpower game plan did not include CPC ASI predictions, Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA) effects on ASI, or previous downpower differences between predicted ASI and the core operating limit supervisory system (COLSS) ASI.  There has been one similar event reported within the last three years in LER 2-2000-007-00.re changes and training.",
