## Project Overview

### [Assignment 1](assignment_1/Assignment_1.ipynb)
- In Assignment 1, we tackle the fascinating task of carpet classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Dive into the world of image recognition as we train and evaluate deep learning models to identify different carpet patterns.

### [Assignment 2](assignment2/assignment_2_2AMM10_22-23.ipynb)
- Assignment 2 is all about predicting trajectories with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Explore the realm of deep learning applied to graphs as we work on trajectory prediction, a critical task in autonomous systems and robotics.

These assignments offer a hands-on experience in the captivating field of Deep Learning, where we harness the power of neural networks to solve real-world challenges.
