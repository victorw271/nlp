## Project Overview

### Component 1: Aircraft Data Analysis
In Component 1, we delve into the world of aircraft data. Our journey begins with meticulous data annotation, where we carefully label and categorize data elements. With our annotated data in hand, we then proceed to develop a sophisticated model capable of extracting entities and their relations from this dataset.

### Component 2: Nuclear Plant Data Analysis
In Component 2, we broaden our scope by applying the model developed in Component 1 to a more technically complex dataset associated with nuclear plants. Here, our objective is to leverage our model to extract entities and relations from this specialized domain. This transfer of our model from one context to another provides a unique opportunity to assess its adaptability and effectiveness.
